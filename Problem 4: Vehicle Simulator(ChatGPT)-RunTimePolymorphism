        vehicle.startEngine();  // Output: Generic vehicle engine starting…

#Description:

-->Base Class: Vehicle
-->Subclass: Car, Bike
Concept: Override startEngine() to simulate different vehicle behavior.

Methods to Define:

In Vehicle:
void startEngine() → print “Generic vehicle engine starting…”

In Car:
Override startEngine() → print “Car engine starting with key…”

In Bike:
Override startEngine() → print “Bike engine starting with button…”

Instructions:
Use base class reference to point to each subclass object and invoke startEngine().
Demonstrate runtime polymorphism.
